        /*
ConcurrentSkipListMap<K,V> is a thread-safe, sorted map from the java.util.concurrent package.
It implements the ConcurrentNavigableMap interface and is based on a Skip List data structure.
âœ… Key Features:
Thread-safe: Multiple threads can safely access and modify it without external synchronization.
Sorted: Entries are kept in ascending key order (just like TreeMap).
Non-blocking Reads: Thanks to the skip list under the hood, reads donâ€™t block writesâ€”performance win.
Scalable: Ideal for highly concurrent apps that need sorted maps.
ðŸ”§ Use Case:
When you want a concurrent version of TreeMap, use ConcurrentSkipListMap. Itâ€™s faster than synchronized SortedMap in multithreaded environments.
