public class basics {
    /*
Final can be method, variable, class

final variable is like const of c++ we can't change the value of final variable
there will no setter of final variable
only can assign value during initialization
and can assign value only ones

can't override the final methods

we can make a class final so we can't extend that class

can constructor be final?
work of constructor is to make object and final is used to prevent
inheritance but constructor is not inherited. There is no concept
if overriding the constructor so not allowed
