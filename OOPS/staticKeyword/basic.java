 Jab bhi access karna han student ke data members and member function
 ko woh hum Student class kar obj bana kar access kar paa rahe haa

 to make a change so we can access it from class instead access it from
 instance we make it static

 example : to count no. of student
 Without static : every student obj make a new count with initial value 0
 and not able to update it when new student obj is created as it is getting
 access from the obj of that class

 With static : to directly access the count we make it static so it will create when class is created
 not when object is created and can update it every time when new obj(student) is made


That is why psvm is static because jvm directly call the function
without make obj of that class where we made the psvm


static method can not use non static data member or call non-static
method directly

this and super keyword can't be used with static

static block are used for performing static initialization for one time setup task


static is used in utils class where we call method with help of class
like max, min, sqrt method of Math class etc

static can be class, member, methods, blocks
