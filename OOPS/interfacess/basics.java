class is blueprint for object

interface is blueprint for class

abstract class padhi thi we give a blueprint to method so how to create
abstract class also gives blueprint to a class
but abstract class can have concrete method(fully defined)

But interfaces only have abstract methods and static constants only
Interface is used achieve multiple inheritance and pure abstraction

there will be no obj of Animal interface as it does not have any implementation
there will be no constructor also as we can't make its object


IN JAVA 8 interface can have static and default methods also
Why static method?
it can tell complex business logic tell more about the interface
util class use interface help to reduce code
static method can only be accessed from interface only



Why default method?
the implementation class inherit these methods
can access using the instance of the class.
Needed because if we make the abstract method we need to implement
it in the derived class(implementation classes) to overcome that
default method come into picture


Why huge need of default method?
suppose made an interface is implemented by 100 of classes
we added new class so need to implement in all 100 classes
there default method come


Can interface have main method?
Yes it is static and JVM don't need to make obj of that


Diff btw abstract class and interface
abstract class : can have concrete method, have instance variable, due to instance variable it have constructor also
one class can extend only one abstract class
Where one interface can be implemented by as many classes
