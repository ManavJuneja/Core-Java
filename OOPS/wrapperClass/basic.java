    Can't use primitive data type in list.
Java is not a purely object-oriented language because it has primitive data types like int, char, boolean, double, etc.,
which are not objects.
A pure object-oriented language requires that everything should be an object,
but Java allows primitive types for performance optimization.

Key Reasons Why Java is Not 100% Object-Oriented:
Primitive Data Types 🏹
Java has eight primitive types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean).
These are not objects and don’t have methods like objects do.

Static Methods 🚀
Java allows static methods (e.g., Math.sqrt()), which belong to a class but can be used without creating an object.

Operators Work on Primitives ➕
You can use operators (+, -, *, /) directly on primitives, which is not possible in purely object-oriented languages like Smalltalk.

Wrapper Classes Exist 🏗️
Java provides wrapper classes (Integer, Double, etc.) to convert primitives into objects, but these exist separately from the primitives themselves.

static Keyword 📌

Static members exist independently of instances, meaning they don’t follow strict OOP principles.
