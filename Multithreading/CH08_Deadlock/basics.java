public class basics {
/*
A deadlock occurs in concurrent programming
 when two or more threads are blocked forever,
  each waiting for the other to release a resource.
   This typically happens when threads hold locks on resources
   and request additional locks held by other threads.
   For example, Thread A holds Lock 1 and waits for Lock 2,
   while Thread B holds Lock 2 and waits for Lock 1.
    Since neither thread can proceed, they remain stuck in
     a deadlock state.
     Deadlocks can severely impact system performance and are challenging to debug and resolve in multi-threaded applications.
