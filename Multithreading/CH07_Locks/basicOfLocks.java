    /*
Locking in threads is a way to prevent multiple threads from accessing shared data at the same time.

Intrinsic Lock -> Built into every object in java you don't see them, but they're there.
When you use synchronized keyword, you are using these automatic locks.

Explicit Lock -> More advanced lock you can control yourself using the Lock class from java.util.concurrent.locks
You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more control over how and when people can write in notebook.
